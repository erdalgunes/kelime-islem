# Decision Making Process

## Decision Framework

### Types of Decisions

#### Type 1: Reversible Decisions
- Low risk, easily changeable
- Individual developers can make
- Document in PR or issue
- Examples: Code style, small refactors

#### Type 2: Hard-to-Reverse Decisions
- High impact, costly to change
- Require team discussion
- Need formal approval
- Examples: Architecture, dependencies

### Decision Matrix

| Impact | Reversibility | Process | Approval | Timeline |
|--------|--------------|---------|----------|----------|
| Low | Easy | Individual choice | Self | Immediate |
| Low | Hard | Team discussion | Tech Lead | 1 day |
| High | Easy | RFC (light) | Team consensus | 2-3 days |
| High | Hard | RFC (full) | Team + stakeholders | 1 week |

## Decision Making Methods

### 1. Autocratic
**When to Use**: Emergency, time-critical
**Process**: Tech lead decides
**Example**: Production hotfix approach

### 2. Consultative
**When to Use**: Technical decisions
**Process**: Gather input, lead decides
**Example**: Framework selection

### 3. Consensus
**When to Use**: Team processes
**Process**: Discussion until agreement
**Example**: Sprint planning

### 4. Democratic
**When to Use**: Equal valid options
**Process**: Vote after discussion
**Example**: Meeting time selection

## RFC Process (Request for Comments)

### When to Write an RFC
- Major architectural changes
- New technology adoption
- Breaking API changes
- Process overhauls
- Cross-team impacts

### RFC Template
```markdown
# RFC: [Title]

**Author**: @username
**Status**: Draft/Review/Accepted/Rejected
**Created**: Date
**Updated**: Date

## Summary
One paragraph explanation

## Motivation
Why are we doing this?

## Detailed Design
### Current State
How things work today

### Proposed Change
What we're proposing

### Implementation Plan
1. Phase 1: ...
2. Phase 2: ...

## Alternatives Considered
### Option A
- Pros:
- Cons:

### Option B
- Pros:
- Cons:

## Trade-offs
- What we gain
- What we lose
- What stays the same

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Risk 1 | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | How to handle |

## Success Metrics
- How we measure success
- Expected outcomes
- Timeline for evaluation

## Timeline
- RFC Review: X days
- Implementation: Y weeks
- Rollout: Z weeks

## Open Questions
- [ ] Question 1
- [ ] Question 2
```

### RFC Lifecycle
```
Draft → Review → Revision → Final Comment Period → Decision → Implementation
  ↓        ↓         ↓              ↓                ↓            ↓
1 day    3 days    2 days        2 days          1 day     Per timeline
```

### RFC Review Process
1. **Author** creates RFC as GitHub Discussion
2. **Team** reviews and comments (3 days)
3. **Author** addresses feedback (2 days)
4. **Final Comment Period** (2 days)
5. **Decision** made and documented
6. **Implementation** begins if approved

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

### ADR Template
```markdown
# ADR-[number]: [Title]

## Status
Proposed/Accepted/Rejected/Deprecated/Superseded by ADR-[number]

## Context
What is the issue we're seeing?

## Decision
What we've decided to do

## Consequences
### Positive
- Good outcome 1
- Good outcome 2

### Negative
- Trade-off 1
- Trade-off 2

### Neutral
- Side effect 1
- Side effect 2

## References
- Link to RFC
- Link to discussion
- External resources
```

### ADR Guidelines
- Number sequentially (ADR-001, ADR-002)
- Never delete, mark as superseded
- Keep in `/docs/adr/` directory
- Link from relevant code/docs
- Review quarterly

## Quick Decisions

### Spike Process
For research/investigation needs:
1. Create spike issue (timeboxed)
2. Conduct research
3. Document findings
4. Present recommendations
5. Make decision

### Proof of Concept (PoC)
For validating approaches:
1. Define success criteria
2. Timebox effort (max 1 week)
3. Build minimal version
4. Evaluate against criteria
5. Decision based on results

## Decision Meetings

### Preparation
- [ ] Clear agenda sent 24h before
- [ ] Background materials shared
- [ ] Options documented
- [ ] Success criteria defined

### During Meeting
- [ ] Timekeeper assigned
- [ ] Note-taker assigned
- [ ] All voices heard
- [ ] Options discussed
- [ ] Decision recorded

### After Meeting
- [ ] Decision documented
- [ ] Action items assigned
- [ ] Timeline established
- [ ] Stakeholders informed

## Conflict Resolution

### Disagreement Protocol
1. **Understand**: Each side explains position
2. **Find Common Ground**: What we agree on
3. **Identify Differences**: Where we diverge
4. **Evaluate Options**: Pros/cons objectively
5. **Decide**: Using appropriate method
6. **Commit**: Disagree and commit if needed

### Escalation Path
```
Team Discussion
      ↓
Tech Lead Decision
      ↓
Stakeholder Input
      ↓
External Arbitration
```

## Decision Documentation

### Where to Document

| Decision Type | Location |
|--------------|----------|
| Architecture | ADR + Code |
| Process | Team Charter |
| Technical | RFC + Wiki |
| Feature | Issue + PR |
| Bug Fix | PR description |

### Documentation Requirements
- **What** was decided
- **Why** it was decided
- **Who** made the decision
- **When** it was made
- **Alternatives** considered
- **Trade-offs** accepted

## Decision Metrics

### Track Monthly
- Number of decisions made
- Time to decision (average)
- Decisions reversed
- RFC participation rate

### Review Quarterly
- Decision quality outcomes
- Process effectiveness
- Team satisfaction
- Areas for improvement

## Common Decisions

### Technology Selection
1. Define requirements
2. Research options
3. Create comparison matrix
4. PoC if needed
5. Team review
6. Document in ADR

### API Design
1. Draft specification
2. Review with consumers
3. Consider versioning
4. Security review
5. Document decision

### Process Changes
1. Identify problem
2. Propose solution
3. Trial period (1 sprint)
4. Measure impact
5. Team vote
6. Update documentation

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Decision Paralysis
- Over-analyzing
- Seeking perfect solution
- Endless discussion

### ❌ Rushed Decisions
- Not gathering input
- Skipping documentation
- Ignoring alternatives

### ❌ Decision Reversal
- Frequently changing course
- Not committing to decisions
- Second-guessing

### ❌ Silent Disagreement
- Not voicing concerns
- Passive resistance
- Undermining decisions

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do's
- Time-box discussions
- Document everything
- Consider trade-offs
- Measure outcomes
- Learn from decisions

### ✅ Disagree and Commit
- Voice disagreement
- Once decided, fully support
- Give honest effort
- Evaluate results objectively

### ✅ Continuous Improvement
- Regular retrospectives
- Adjust process as needed
- Learn from mistakes
- Celebrate good decisions
