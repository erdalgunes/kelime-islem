# Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview
This document outlines performance best practices for the Kelime İşlem application.

## Build Performance

### Gradle Configuration
- Parallel execution enabled via `org.gradle.parallel=true`
- Daemon mode for faster incremental builds
- Build cache enabled for reusable outputs

### CI/CD Optimizations
- GitHub Actions caching for dependencies
- Parallel test execution across platforms
- Gradle home cache cleanup for optimal storage

## Runtime Performance

### Memory Management
- Lazy initialization for heavy components
- Proper resource cleanup in composables
- Memory-efficient data structures

### Rendering Optimizations
- Compose compiler optimizations enabled
- Stable and immutable annotations for recomposition control
- Key-based animations for smooth transitions

## Monitoring
- Coverage reports via Kover
- Performance metrics in CI pipeline
- Build scan integration for detailed analysis

## Best Practices
1. Always measure before optimizing
2. Profile on actual devices
3. Monitor CI build times
4. Keep dependencies up to date
